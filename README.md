## Loading the Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the MNIST dataset, a large database of handwritten digits commonly used for training various image processing systems.

```python
# Example of loading the MNIST dataset
from keras.datasets import mnist
(trainX, trainY), (testX, testY) = mnist.load_data()
